== What Youâ€™ll Learn

This guide explains how to use Hazelcast in the Istio environment. You'll learn how to set up a Hazelcast cluster and connect it with Hazelcast client. Then, you will also see how to deploy an application with embedded Hazelcast.

== Prerequisites

=== Kubernetes Cluster
In this guide, a Google Kubernetes Engine is used but you can use any Kubernetes cluster you choose.
----
gcloud container clusters create hazelcast-cluster --num-nodes=4
----

=== Istio 1.7.3
This code sample has been tested against Istio 1.7.3

****

Firstly, let's download Istio and configure the path for `istioctl`:
----
curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | sh -
export PATH=`pwd`/`ls | grep istio`/bin:$PATH
----

Install Istio CRDs:
----
istioctl install --set profile=demo --skip-confirmation
----

Verify both istioctl client and control plane has the same version:
----
$ istioctl version
client version: 1.7.3
control plane version: 1.7.3
data plane version: 1.7.3 (2 proxies)
----
****

=== Code Sample

Clone this repository and apply RBAC. RBAC is needed by https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes[hazelcast-kubernetes] plugin discovery.
----
git clone https://github.com/hazelcast-guides/istio.git
cd istio
kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml
----

Istio Sidecar AutoInjection is done automatically if you label default namespace with `istio-injection`. If you want to implement manual injection with the deployments then you need to use `istioctl kube-inject`.
----
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
----

== Hazelcast-Istio Code Sample

The business logic in both examples are the same to keep it simple. `put` operation puts a key-value pair to Hazelcast and `get` operation returns the value together with the Kubernetes Pod name. `PodName` is used to show that the value is returned from any Pod inside the Kubernetes cluster to prove the true nature of distributed cache.

=== Hazelcast Client Server

Let's first switch to the client-server directory.

----
cd hazelcast-client-server
----

Client-Server code sample can be built and pushed to your own Docker Hub or some other registry via following command but that is optional.
----
mvn compile com.google.cloud.tools:jib-maven-plugin:1.8.0:build -Dimage=YOUR-NAME/istio-client:1.0
----

Instead, you can use the already pre-built docker image `hazelcastguides/istio-client:1.0`.

****
If you want to build your own image, then do not forget to update `hazelcast-client.yaml` with your own image.
****

Deploy Hazelcast Cluster:
----
kubectl apply -f hazelcast-cluster.yaml
----

You can see that 3 member cluster has been initiated with 3 pods. `2/2` in `READY` column means that there are 2 containers running in each Pod. One is Hazelcast member and the other is Envoy Proxy.

----
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hazelcast-cluster-0   2/2     Running   0          60s
hazelcast-cluster-1   2/2     Running   0          44s
hazelcast-cluster-2   2/2     Running   0          27s
----

Deploy Spring Boot Application with Hazelcast Client:
----
kubectl apply -f hazelcast-client.yaml
----

Check logs and see that Spring Boot service is connected to the cluster:
----
$ kubectl logs hazelcast-client-0 hazelcast-client
...
Members [3] {
	Member [10.16.2.14]:5701 - 51274b4d-dc7f-4647-9ceb-c32bfc922c95
	Member [10.16.1.15]:5701 - 465cfefa-9b26-472d-a204-addf3b82d40a
	Member [10.16.2.15]:5701 - 67fdf27a-e7b7-4ed7-adf1-c00f785d2325
}
...
----

Let's now run a container with curl installed and set an environment variable to point to Spring Load Balancer.

First, find the IP of Spring Boot Service:
----
$ kubectl get svc springboot-service
NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
springboot-service   ClusterIP   10.19.250.127   <none>        80/TCP    3m29s
----

Launch a `curl` container inside Kubernetes cluster and set the service IP as an environment variable:
----
kubectl run curl --rm --image=radial/busyboxplus:curl -i --tty
SPRINGBOOT_SERVICE=10.19.250.127
----

Put a value to the cluster:
----
$ curl "${SPRINGBOOT_SERVICE}/put?key=1&value=2"
{"value":"2","podName":"hazelcast-embedded-2"}
----

Get the value from cluster in a loop and see that it is retrieved from different Pod names:
----
$ while true; do curl "${SPRINGBOOT_SERVICE}/get?key=1"; sleep 2;echo; done
{"value":"2","podName":"hazelcast-embedded-1"}
{"value":"2","podName":"hazelcast-embedded-0"}
...
----

In this sample, you were able to deploy a Spring Boot based microservice with Hazelcast client-server topology in Istio Environment.

Clean up the deployments with the following commands:
----
kubectl delete -f hazelcast-client.yaml
kubectl delete -f hazelcast-cluster.yaml
----

=== Hazelcast Embedded

Switch to embedded code sample directory:
----
cd hazelcast-embedded
----

Embedded code sample can be built and pushed to your own Docker Hub or some other registry via following command but that is optional:
----
mvn compile com.google.cloud.tools:jib-maven-plugin:1.8.0:build -Dimage=YOUR-NAME/istio-embedded:1.0
----

Instead, you can use the already pre-built docker image `hazelcastguides/istio-embedded:1.0`.

****
If you want to build your own image, then do not forget to update `hazelcast-embedded.yaml` with your own image.
****

Deploy Hazelcast Embedded Sample:
----
$ kubectl apply -f hazelcast-embedded.yaml
statefulset.apps/hazelcast-embedded created
service/hazelcast-embedded-headless created
service/springboot-service created
----

You can check that the application started and that Hazelcast successfully formed a cluster.

----
$ kubectl logs pod/hazelcast-embedded-0 hazelcast-embedded
...
Members {size:3, ver:3} [
        Member [10.12.1.6]:5701 - 644e6bbf-335a-410b-80ab-0cb648dbc772
        Member [10.12.2.8]:5701 - 0ab13148-b6bb-477e-970b-0b5c226ed2aa this
        Member [10.12.3.4]:5701 - 72f56c90-f55e-490c-b3c0-d40fe970557f
]
...
----


When you list the services used, you will see that you have two Kubernetes Services: `hazelcast-embedded-headless` and `springboot-service`. `hazelcast-embedded-headless` is used to handle Hazelcast cluster discovery operation so it has no need to have an IP address. `springboot-service` is the loadbalancer that is used to receive http requests and forward them to one of the underlying pods to respond.
----
$ kubectl get svc
NAME                          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
hazelcast-embedded-headless   ClusterIP   None           <none>        5701/TCP   9s
kubernetes                    ClusterIP   10.19.240.1    <none>        443/TCP    73m
springboot-service            ClusterIP   10.19.252.76   <none>        80/TCP     9s
----

Let's now put a key-value pair into Hazelcast cluster through Spring Boot REST Service and then call get operation in a loop to see the value is returned from different Pods.

Firstly, let's run a container with `curl` installed and set an environment variable to point to Spring Load Balancer:
----
kubectl run curl --rm --image=radial/busyboxplus:curl -i --tty
SPRINGBOOT_SERVICE=10.19.252.76
----

Put a value to the cluster:
----
$ curl "${SPRINGBOOT_SERVICE}/put?key=1&value=2"
{"value":"2","podName":"hazelcast-embedded-2"}
----

Get the value from cluster in a loop and see that it is retrieved from different Pod names:
----
$ while true; do curl "${SPRINGBOOT_SERVICE}/get?key=1"; sleep 2;echo; done
{"value":"2","podName":"hazelcast-embedded-1"}
{"value":"2","podName":"hazelcast-embedded-0"}
...
----

In this sample, you were able to deploy a Spring Boot based microservice with Hazelcast Embedded in Istio Environment. Let's clean up deployments with the following command.

----
kubectl delete -f hazelcast-embedded.yaml
----

== Summary

This guide demonstrates how to use Hazelcast Embedded and Client-Server topology in mTLS enabled Istio environment with Automatic Sidecar Injection. Hazelcast continuously tries to support cloud native technologies and verifies those environments as they evolve.
